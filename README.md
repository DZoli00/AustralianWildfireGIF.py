This project presents the evolution of one of the biggest wildfires in the history of Australia. The WFire.py file generates the map of Australia and puts the points on the map where the fire was, based on longitude and latitude coordinates. We can find the coordinates of the fire in the CleanedDataV4.csv file. The .py file generates the evolution of the fire on the map for each day from 1st August to 30th September.
